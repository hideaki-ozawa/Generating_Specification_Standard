bend elbow.  But in case it is difficult to make good piping arrangement with two times, 
bend elbow may be used.  Welding fittings may be employed in place of pipe bends. 
 
In case that the bend elbows are used, the radius of bends shall be one or one and half 
times of nominal diameter. 
 
The system shall be designed to allow for all stresses due to thermal expansions and 
deflections of ship’s structure. 
Except where otherwise noted, expansion shall be compensated by using bends.

be made tight by means of three spool flanges or direct welded pipes.  
Connections through insulated bulkheads shall be of sufficient length to permit access to 
flanged connection without disturbing the insulation.  
 
The directly welded pipes shall be employed for piping penetrated through tank walls 
constructed with hull, such as sounding pipes, pump suction pipes and vent pipes. 
 
Where galvanized piping is specified, the galvanizing shall be done after the pipe is 
fabricated and flanges are attached thereon in shop, except for screwed ends which may be 
attached after galvanizing.

forced circulation system shall be pickled before installation.  After fitting out onboard, 
they shall be cleaned by flushing with the lubricating oil which is prepared as system oil. 
 
Packing used for all pipe lines, in general, shall be of multipurpose type or reinforced

chest, perforated strainer plates of galvanized steel may be used. 
 
Strainer grids or plates shall have a clear area not less than two times cross sectional area 
of the connected pipe, and shall be secured so that no part extends beyond the shell.  The 
bolts or studs and nuts for securing strainer grid or plates shall be of stainless steel.  The
