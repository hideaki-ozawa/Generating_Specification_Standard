 (6) Fuel oil consumption measuring  
 
These shop tests shall be carried out after coupling the engine with generator at the engine 
Maker’s shop.  The said load shall mean the generator load. 
 
For pump and air compressor 
 
 (1) Performance test 
   Performance test shall be carried out for each set but in case two or more than two 
   sets of same kind and capacity are installed, performance test shall be carried out 
   only for one set. 
 
 (2) Continuous running test 
   Continuous running test at full load for each set shall be carried out. 
   The said tests shall be executed according to the Maker’s usual practice by using 
   available facilities in the Maker’s shop. 
 
For oil purifier 
 
The shop test shall be carried out according to the Maker’s standard and usual practice. 
 
For fresh water generator 
 
The shop test shall not be carried out. 
The operating test shall be carried out onboard during sea trial. 
 
 

P-17





1.4  FUEL OIL CONSUMPTION OF MAIN ENGINE

draining if necessary.  The drain plugs shall not be fitted in way of cofferdams or voids.  
The lines which necessitate draining frequently shall be fitted with valves or traps, or both. 
 
The radius of bends in steel pipe shall be about two times the nominal diameter except for 
bend elbow.  But in case it is difficult to make good piping arrangement with two times, 
bend elbow may be used.  Welding fittings may be employed in place of pipe bends. 
 
In case that the bend elbows are used, the radius of bends shall be one or one and half 
times of nominal diameter.

be made tight by means of three spool flanges or direct welded pipes.  
Connections through insulated bulkheads shall be of sufficient length to permit access to 
flanged connection without disturbing the insulation.  
 
The directly welded pipes shall be employed for piping penetrated through tank walls 
constructed with hull, such as sounding pipes, pump suction pipes and vent pipes. 
 
Where galvanized piping is specified, the galvanizing shall be done after the pipe is 
fabricated and flanges are attached thereon in shop, except for screwed ends which may be 
attached after galvanizing.
