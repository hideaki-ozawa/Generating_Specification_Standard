Mansell No. ---- 7.5 BG 7/2 

As for main and auxiliary machinery in engine room and electric equipment, refer to the description inⅢ- MACHINERY PART andⅣ- ELECTRIC PART respectively. 

6.3    PRIMARY SURFACE PREPARATION AND SHOP PRIMER

The steel plates and section steels of 5  ㎜ and above in thickness for hull structural members which are to be coated with paint shall be shot-blasted to remove mill scale and rust. 

Other steel plates and section steels, equipment, pipes, forgings, etc. shall not be shot-blasted. 

Generally, the grade of surface preparation shall be of Sa.2.5 of SIS ( Swedish Standard SIS 055900-1967 ) for steel plates and Sa.2 for section steels. 

Steel surfaces treated by the shot-blasting shall be coated immediately after the blasting, with one (1) coat of shop primer except otherwise specified to prevent rusting during the construction. 

As to steel surfaces other than shot-blasting is specified, the steel surfaces shall be cleaned prior to painting by disc sanders and/or wire brushes manually in accordance with the Builder’s practice.

6.4    SECONDARY SURFACE PREPARATION

Steel surface shall be cleaned prior to painting by disc sander and/or wire brushes manually according to the Builder’s practice. 

The grade of surface preparation shall be as follows : 

Compartment

Outside of shell and tankStructure and outfitting in weather partInterior area

Damaged part

Pt2Pt2 Pt1

Processed part

Pt2.5Pt2 Pt1

The grade of surface preparation in above list shall be based on JSRA SPSS 1998 ( Standard for the Preparation of Steel Surface prior to Painting ). 

Damaged part means steel surface having white zinc salt or rust in the form of spots. 

Processed part means steel surface in way of hand welding, automatic welding or gas burning. 

Surface treatment shall not be made to the area of F.O. tank, D.O. tank, etc. where rust preventive oil shall be coated. 

The edges and corners of steel structure in fresh water tanks and drinking water tank except rolled sections shall be treated by builder’s standard procedure. ( One pass grinding )

6.5    PAINTING

Painting schedule shall be as shown on SUBSECTION 6.7 PAINTING SCHEDULE. 

Painting work shall be performed by airless spray as far as possible, and where the use of airless spray is restricted due to lack of working spaces, etc., roller and/or hand brush shall be used. 

Generally, shop primer shall not be touched up wherever taken off due to burnt damage or mechanical damage after fabrication. 

However, in case when over-coating is impracticable immediately after cleaning due to the Builder’s construction schedule, shop primer shall be touched up. 

Generally, galvanized parts, chromium plated parts, brass, bronze, aluminium, stainless steel, plastics, glass, rubber, copper, wooden shelf, etc. shall not be coated with paint except otherwise specified.
