3.4    SPEED, FUEL OIL CONSUMPTION AND ENDURANCE.  

Trial speed at normal output of main engine on the Builder's favourable draught and trim condition 15.1  knots. 

Service speed on the designed loaded draught ( 11.30 m moulded ) at normal output of main engine with 15% sea margin  abt.  14.5  knots.

Designed fuel oil consumption ( for main engine only ), at normal rating on the basis of fuel oil of which net calorific value of 40,600 kJ/kg  abt.  26.0  tons/day. 

Note: This consumption figure shall be subject to a tolerance margin of five (5)% (Complying with MARPOL 73/78 ANNEX VI Reg.13-Tier II restriction). 

Endurance at the above-mentioned service speed calculated from above-mentioned fuel oil consumption and aforementioned fuel oil capacity excluding diesel oil under the following conditions Fuel oil filling ratio  0.90 Fuel oil specific gravity  0.98  abt.  24,600  sea miles.

Designed fuel oil consumption ( for main engine only ), at 14.0 knots with 15% sea margin on the designed loaded draught on the basis of fuel oil of which net calorific value of 40,600 kJ/kg (for reference)  abt.  23.0  tons/day.

Note: This consumption figure shall be subject to a tolerance margin of six (6)% (Complying with MARPOL 73/78 ANNEX VI Reg.13-Tier II restriction). 

Endurance at 14.0 knots with 15% sea margin on the designed loaded draught, calculated from above-mentioned fuel oil consumption and aforementioned fuel oil capacity excluding diesel oil under the following conditions Fuel oil filling ratio 0.90 Fuel oil specific gravity  0.98  abt.  26,800  sea miles.
