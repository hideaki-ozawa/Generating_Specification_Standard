4.2  AUXILIARY BOILER .

4.2.1 Construction.

The boiler shall consist of the doughnut shaped steam drum and water drum which are 
connected by two rows of water tubes.

The flame of oil burning side shall transfer heat to water in inside water tubes by radiation.  
It shall become the combustion gas and be branched into two rows of water tubes and 
meet at the exit and be discharged from the funnel. 
Contact heat transfer shall be made when water passes in water tubes and heat be 
transferred to water efficiently.

The exhaust gas side shall be provided with a group of a water tubes reasonably arranged 
circumferentially on upper and lower drums to transfer heat efficiently. 
The exhaust gas inflowed through the flue shall be separated in two directions of left-hand 
and right-hand to effect heat exchange and discharged through the outlet funnel as low 
temperature exhaust gas.

Inner and outer casings shall be available.  Heat insulating material shall be placed 
between inner and outer casings to check radiation of heat. 
Insulating fire clay shall be placed in the lower part of the furnace and narrowed part of 
gas shorting.
