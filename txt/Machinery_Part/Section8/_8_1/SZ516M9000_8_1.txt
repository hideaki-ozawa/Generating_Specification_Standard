8.1  COOLER AND CONDENSER .

8.1.1  Shell and tube type heat exchanger.

One (1) auxiliary drain condenser shall have a sufficient capacity to condense excess 
steam from the exhaust gas section of aux. boiler.

This heat exchanger shall be of horizontal shell and tube type.  Tube shall be straight, 
and tube end of sea water inlet side shall be expanded into tube plates.

The materials shall be as follows:.

 Shell Steel plate or steel pipe 
 Shell cover Cast iron ( inside epoxy paint ) 
 Tube plate Naval brass 
 Tube Aluminum brass.

The fittings and accessories shall be as follows:.

 3 － thermometers 
 1 － compound gauge for condenser 
 1 － peep hole for shell except small size cooler 
 Necessary number － air cock and drain cock for shell and shell cover 
 1 － set of protecting anode ( Zn ) for each water chest of sea water 
 1 － set of chemical clean. flange for both tube and shell side except small size cooler.

8.1.2  Plate type heat exchanger.

Each one (1) set of jacket cool. F.W. cooler and main L.O. cooler respectively shall have a 
sufficient capacity to meet max. output requirement of main engine. 
Two (2) sets of D/G cool. F.W. cooler shall have a sufficient capacity to meet max. output  
requirement of three (3) sets of main diesel generator engine and two (2) sets of main air  
compressor.

The materials shall be as follows:.

 Frame plate Mild steel 
 Plate Titanium.

The heat exchangers attached to main engine, main diesel generator engines and other 
machinery shall be in accordance with Maker’s standard.

The design conditions for heat exchangers shall be as following table.
