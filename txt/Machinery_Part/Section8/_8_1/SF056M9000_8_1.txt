8.1  COOLER AND CONDENSER .

8.1.1  Shell and tube type heat exchanger.

One (1) auxiliary condenser shall have a sufficient capacity to condense excess steam 
from the exhaust gas section of aux. boiler.

This heat exchanger shall be of horizontal shell and tube type.  Tube shall be straight, 
and tube end of fresh water inlet side shall be expanded into tube plates.

The materials shall be as follows:.

 Shell Steel plate or steel pipe 
 Shell cover Cast iron 
 Tube plate Naval brass 
 Tube Aluminum brass.

The fittings and accessories shall be as follows:.

 3 - thermometers 
 1 - compound gauge for condenser 
 1 - peep hole for shell except small size cooler 
 Necessary number - air cock and drain cock for shell and shell cover 
 1 - set of chemical clean. flange for both tube and shell side except small size cooler.

8.1.2  Plate type heat exchanger.

Each one (1) set of central cooling F.W. cooler shall have a sufficient capacity to meet 
50% of max. output requirement of main engine and auxiliary. One (1) main L.O. cooler 
respectively shall have a sufficient capacity to meet max. output requirement of main 
engine. Sea water side of central cool. F.W. cooler shall be provided the back washing 
line.

The materials shall be as follows:.

 Frame plate Mild steel 
 Plate Titanium ( in case of sea water cooling ) 
  Stainless ( in case of fresh water cooling ).

 M8 - 2.

The heat exchangers attached to main engine, main diesel generator engines and other 
machinery shall be in accordance with Maker’s standard.
