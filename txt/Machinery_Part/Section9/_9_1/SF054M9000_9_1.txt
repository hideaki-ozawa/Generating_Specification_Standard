9.1  GENERAL .

There shall be installed one fresh water generator, utilizing the waste heat in the jacket 
water from the main engine.

The fresh water generator shall produce fresh water of salinity not exceeding 10 P.P.M of 
salt at abt. 85°C main engine jacket water temperature and 32°C cooling sea water 
temperature.

The distilling cycle shall be as follows:.

Jacket water from the main engine cooling F.W. outlet shall be led to the evaporator. 
Sea water branched from condenser cooling sea water outlet shall be led to the evaporator 
and heated by the fresh water from the main engine cooling system.

Sea water shall be evaporated in separator shell at a comparatively low temperature due to 
the vacuum produced by means of the water ejector.

The vapour shall be led into the condenser through the deflector and demister and then 
condensed by the cooling sea water. 
The brine, concentrated sea water, shall be constantly taken out from the evaporator and 
discharged to over board.

The ejector pump shall supply sea water to water ejector.  The distillate pump shall take 
the fresh water produce from the condenser of the fresh water generator and transfer it to 
the fresh water tank.
